Today, I came across something in the OFL entity while reviewing the member.json file's business logic. It appears that we're utilizing the ocd_enrichs_prd.PROVIDER_TYPE XREF table. From what I know, this table is an ACC table and undergoes truncation and loading each time. Could you please verify if it's intentionally included in the business logic or if it was mistakenly added? Thank you for your assistance.
